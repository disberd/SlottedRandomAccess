It should be a function (or callable) that takes no argument and return an NTuple{N, Int} with the time slots of each replica (without repetitions).\n\nnote: Note\nThe current implementation still assumes that there is only a single replica per time slot, so while the time_slots_function is arbitrary, potentially wrong results will be returned if this is not the case.\n\nConstructors\n\nMF_CRDSA{N}()\n\nDefault construct, which assumes N time slots (so one per replica) and that one replica is sent in each time slot (randomizing over the frequency slots).\n\nMF_CRDSA{N}(n_time_slots::Int, time_slots_function)\n\nMore advanced constructor for the MF-CRDSA scheme, which allows specifying a number of time slots different than the number of replicas and the function to be used to generate randomly the time slots to use for each user in each frame.\n\nExample\n\nThe code below will generate a MF-CRDSA scheme with 2 replicas and 3 time slots, where the first time slot is always used for the first replica, while the second replica is sent randomly either in the 2nd or 3rd slot.\n\njulia> scheme = MF_CRDSA{2}(3, () -> (1, rand(2:3)))\n\nSee also: CRDSA\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#SlottedRandomAccess.PLR_Simulation","page":"SlottedRandomAccess.jl","title":"SlottedRandomAccess.PLR_Simulation","text":"struct PLR_Simulation\n\nType containing the parameters and results of a PLR simulation.\n\nFields\n\nparams::PLR_SimulationParameters: Parameters used for the simulation\nresults::StructArrays.StructArray{SlottedRandomAccess.PLR_Simulation_Point}: Results of the simulation\nscatter_kwargs::Dict{Symbol, Any}: The list of keyword arguments passed to the scatter call for plotting\n\nConstructors\n\nPLR_Simulation(load::AbstractVector; kwargs...)\n\nCreate a PLR_Simulation object by simply providing the load vector.
