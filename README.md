# SlottedRandomAccess

This repository implements the simulations tools for computing the Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) of slotted random access schemes.

The following schemes are currently supported:
- **CRDSA**: Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted ALOHA, introduced in [this 2007 IEEE paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.348337)
- **MF-CRDSA**: Multi-Frequency Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted ALOHA, introduced in [this 2017 IEEE paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2696952)
